Lets Say This is My Query TO GET Top REcords or something similar


*** SLOW****
select Name from Candidate where id = (select Top 1 candidateId from Vote group by CandidateId order by Count(candidateId) desc)

***FAST****
select Name from Candidate where id 
IN (select top 1 candidateId from Vote group by CandidateId order by Count(candidateId) desc)


**** FASTER***
select Name from Candidate where id 
IN (select candidateId from Vote group by CandidateId order by Count(candidateId) desc offset 0 rows fetch next 1 rows only)
