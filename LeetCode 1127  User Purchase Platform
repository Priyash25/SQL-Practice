https://leetcode.com/problems/user-purchase-platform/


The Goal is to have for each date all three types of platform which is why we create Table m1 and then LEFT JOIN with a table t2
that takes the date, user and what type of user and his sum which later can be used with the date and platform to find the end result.

select t.spend_date, t.platform, IFNULL(SUM(t2.amt),0) as total_amount, COUNT( t2.platform)  as total_users 
FROM
(
    select * 
    FROM
 (
    SELECT DISTINCT spend_date, 'mobile' as platform FROM Spending
    UNION ALL
    SELECT DISTINCT spend_date, 'desktop' as platform FROM Spending
    UNION ALL
    SELECT DISTINCT spend_date, 'both' as platform FROM Spending
  ) m1 
) t
        
LEFT JOIN 

(select spend_date,user_id, CASE WHEN COUNT(user_id)>1 THEN 'both' ELSE platform END as platform, SUM(amount) amt 
 FROM Spending 
 GROUP BY spend_date,user_id
) t2 

ON t.spend_date=t2.spend_date AND t.platform=t2.platform

GROUP BY t.spend_date, t.platform
