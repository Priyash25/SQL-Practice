With recursive 
cte as (select v.user_id, SUM(CASE when visit_date=transaction_date then 1 else 0 end) transactions_count FROM Visits v LEFT JOIN Transactions t 
ON v.user_id=t.user_id and v.visit_date=t.transaction_date group by v.user_id, v.visit_date)
,
cte2 as (select 0 as cnt
   union all
   select cnt + 1
   from cte2
   where cnt < (select max(transactions_count) FROM cte)
        )

select cte2.cnt as transactions_count, COALESCE(COUNT(user_id),0) as visits_count from cte2 left join cte on cnt=transactions_count group by cnt
